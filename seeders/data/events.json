I went on to work in different restaurants and taquerias in Mazatlán - Mexicali - Guadalajara - Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas - Ímuris, Sonora and Tijuana, Baja California. The last, being my place of birth. I tried to make sure that all the restaurants where I worked were the number one in quality and famous places in the cities where they were located, and I obtained it today, what I humbly do, is a little bit of each of those places. I hope that you like my food. I will try to grow and be able to offer more meals that I know to prepare. I give you my hard work and my dreams with love in every dish I give you.
